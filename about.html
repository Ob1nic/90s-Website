    <h1>ABOUT | ME</h1>
   

    <p>
    If you have come here and are reading this, it is because you are interested in <br>knowing about me.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am Nicolas. Since I was a child I have liked to learn new things and <br>
    replicate them by myself. I am finishing the Architecture and Urbanism <br>
    college, and for a long time I have been studying and learning to program by<br>
    myself. Below is my ranking of languages and tools. Come back here in the <br>
    next few years and you will notice my evolution. I have been working alone in <br>
    several projects like: Programming, Coding, Sustainable Architecture, Comics, <br>
    Games and Illustration.
    <br>
    <br>    
    Why create the site?
    <br>
    <br>
	Just a project to test my ability to create a replica of the<br>
    fascinating sites from the 90's and try to pass my perception of the world with<br>
    brief notes on various subjects.
