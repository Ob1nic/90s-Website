        <p>Certainly, conversion and persuasion are part of the political career, no<br> 
            matter how far persuasion can go.So these artifices have been contradictory <br>
            and dangerous for the unfolding of social policies, and especially for humanity.<br> 
            The political power uses specimens of religious gurus to disseminate its <br>
            "truths", determine what the political faithful should read, follow, talk about,<br>
            and especially attack.
            <br>
            <br>            
            The problem is the attacks on everything and everyone who does not <br>
            agree with the same ideas. Reflecting on the greatest religious <br>
            contradiction...idolatry. They really forget the importance of iconoclasm that <br>
            their religions teach them, and today idolize humans and especially<br>
            politicians.
